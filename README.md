# Continued-Fraction-Calculator
A simple calculator which computes the simple continued fraction representation of a rational number implemented in Java.
I originally wrote this calculator a year ago, but it had some major bugs. To get around this I implemented a basic Fraction class to overcome the limitations of floating-point arithmetic, which is the foundation of this entire project.
